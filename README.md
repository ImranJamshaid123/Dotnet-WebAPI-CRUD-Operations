This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQL Server database using the Data-First approach with Entity Framework. It provides RESTful endpoints to manage records, supporting POST, GET & GET by id, PUT, and DELETE operations. Built with Visual Studio, the API is tested using Postman as well as Swagger UI and adheres to best practices for backend development. It demonstrates the integration of .NET technologies with SQL Server.
